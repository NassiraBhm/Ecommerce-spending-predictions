Project Overview: Optimizing E-commerce Customer Experience

This project leverages a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website) to analyze customer behavior on an e-commerce website. The data encompasses key metrics such as:

Average Session Length: Duration of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on the mobile app.
Time on Website: Average time spent on the website.
Length of Membership: Customer tenure in years.

By examining these metrics, using linear regression techniques in python, we aim to assist the e-commerce company in determining the optimal allocation of resources between their mobile app and website experiences.
